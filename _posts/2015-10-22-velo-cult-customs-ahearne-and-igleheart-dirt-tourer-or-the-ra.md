description: "Velo Cult Customs Ahearne and Igleheart Dirt Tourer I can't help it. I love touring bikes with big, fat, high volume tires and funky stances. This project in particular was born from the mind and abilities of three important individuals, residing in the Portland area under the Velo Cult Customs umbrella."
