description: "Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) just released a pretty great guide for bike commuters. Though it specifically deals with Oregon road law, the suggestions are basic enough they could apply elsewhere in the U.S. as well. The Bicyclist's Survival Guide (see the full PDF here) is nicely organized with four main sections and great safety tips in each."
