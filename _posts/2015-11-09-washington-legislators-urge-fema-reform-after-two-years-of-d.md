description: 'Two years of record-breaking wildfire seasons have ravaged central and eastern Washington, and two years in a row, FEMA has denied individual aid to the survivors. While FEMA has authorized public assistance to governments and tribes in the aftermath, the agency has refused to open up its other line of funding in disaster recovery-direct financial assistance to victims for items like temporary housing and medical bills.'
