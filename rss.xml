            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cyclists Survival Guide</h1><p>Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) just released a pretty great guide for bike commuters. Though it specifically deals with Oregon road law, the suggestions are basic enough they could apply elsewhere in the U.S. as well. The Bicyclist's Survival Guide (see the full PDF here) is nicely organized with four main sections and great safety tips in each.</p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mpHQpEwq8BM/Ub9vBDJU6LI/AAAAAAAACOc/9woINjuW0NI/s640/Screen+Shot+2013-06-17+at+1.02.15+PM.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Bike Commuting Is Taking Off In The Nation's Car Capital</h1><p>Since 2006, Detroit has painted 170 miles of new bike lanes on city streets. People on bikes followed: The Motor City now has the fastest-growing rate of bike commuters in the country. Bike commuting grew over 400% in Detroit from 2000 to 2014, according to a new report the American League of Bicyclists, which pulled from census data.</p><img src="http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2015/10/3052438-inline-s-3-cincinnati.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Cycle Oklahoma Bicycle Route 66?</h1><p>October 27, 2015 Why would I want to ride in Oklahoma? Well, my three buddies and I, one a persuasive Sooner, chose to ride there as part of our annual "Old Guys Tour." Two facts clinched the deal: one, Adventure Cycling had just released its Bicycle Route 66 maps and, two, Oklahoma would be the 47th state of my 50 state bicycle quest.</p><img src="http://www.adventurecycling.org/default/cache/file/A97AF74D-A95D-48A5-3D36B1D95D0653CE.jpg"></article>]]></description>
