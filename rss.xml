            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Versatility of the Bike Helmet</h1><p>Whenever conversations about bike helmets begin, controversy is seldom far behind.

Illustrations: Stephen Haynes When my buddy, Alex, first conjured up the idea of organizing a night ride during the last full moon of summer, I was a bit skeptical to say the least.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ask Beardo: Belt Drives</h1><p>Dear Beardo, I'll cut to right to the chase; you seem like a busy man. Should I buy a belt drive bike? Peace out, Gerard Neyhantor Janesville, Wisconsin Gerard, A belt versus a chain. Good question. At least I assume belt versus chain. Maybe you could be looking at a shaft drive?</p><img src="http://bicycletimesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Beardo-Belt-Drives.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cyclists Survival Guide</h1><p>Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) just released a pretty great guide for bike commuters. Though it specifically deals with Oregon road law, the suggestions are basic enough they could apply elsewhere in the U.S. as well. The Bicyclist's Survival Guide (see the full PDF here) is nicely organized with four main sections and great safety tips in each.</p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mpHQpEwq8BM/Ub9vBDJU6LI/AAAAAAAACOc/9woINjuW0NI/s640/Screen+Shot+2013-06-17+at+1.02.15+PM.png"></article>]]></description>

People on bikes followed: The Motor City now has the fastest-growing rate of bike commuters in the country.
